I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at the Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, under the supervision of Prof. Wenjian Yu since Fall 2018. Previously, I received my B.S. in the School of Computer Science and Engineering from Northeast University in 2018. My major research interests are about graph representation learning, randomized matrix decomposition, and etc.
